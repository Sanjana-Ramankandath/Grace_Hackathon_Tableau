Using data set from Kaggle, I used python to clean the data set. Using the condensed data, I created a dashboard that incorporates some of the 
eye-opening statistics revolving around women in tech when it comes to mental health. The thing that inspired me to do this project was the constant 
news article about mental health issues, its effect on women and non-binary folk and some of the resources/help available for them to tackle it.
